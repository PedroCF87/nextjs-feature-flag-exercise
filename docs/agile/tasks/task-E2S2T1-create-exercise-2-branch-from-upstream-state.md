## 1) Task statement

As a delivery agent, I want to execute E2-S2-T1 with complete traceability and explicit validation so that the parent story can progress without ambiguity.

---

## 2) Verifiable expected outcome

- A concrete deliverable exists for this task and is linked in this document.
- All required sections from the task definition are fully populated (no placeholders).
- Validation evidence is attached with command outputs and/or file references.

---

## 3) Detailed execution plan

**Description:** Create `exercise-2` branch from `f73979ed~1` (parent of first fork commit). This ensures the implementation starts from the original upstream state with zero Exercise 1 implementation code.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- **Given** the fork history is available
- **When** `exercise-2` is created from `f73979ed~1`
- **Then** the branch exists; `git log --oneline -1` shows the correct parent commit; no filtering code is present

---

---

## 4) Architecture and security requirements

- Preserve existing architecture boundaries (no cross-layer shortcuts).
- Validate all external inputs before processing.
- Never hardcode secrets, tokens, or credentials in files.
- Document any security-sensitive decision and fallback/rollback path.
- For data-layer operations, use parameterized queries and explicit resource cleanup.

---

## 5) Validation evidence

Record evidence with exact commands and outputs:

- Command(s) executed:
- Exit code(s):
- Output summary:
- Files created/updated:
- Risks found / mitigations:

### Given / When / Then checks

- **Given** all task dependencies are available and validated,
- **When** this task execution plan is completed and evidence is collected,
- **Then** the task outcome is reproducible, secure, and auditable by another agent.

## 6) Definition of Done

- [ ] Expected outcome is objectively verifiable.
- [ ] Dependencies are explicit and valid.
- [ ] Security and architecture checks were performed.
- [ ] Validation evidence is attached.
- [ ] Parent story acceptance criteria impact is documented.

## 7) Notes for handoff

- Upstream dependencies resolved:
- Downstream items unblocked:
- Open risks (if any):
